<h2>Violation of usage policy</h2>

<p>
    A violation of the usage policy by {{ username }} ({{ realname }})
    on {{ violation.target.host }} was automatically detected starting on {{ timestamp.strftime('%x') }} at {{ timestamp.strftime('%X') }}.
</p>

<p>Because the usage has exceeded the usage policy, the following resource limits will be applied:</p>

    {% for limit, value in limits.items() %}
        <p>
            {{ limit }} : {{ value }}
        
            {% if limit == "CPU" %}
                (cores)
            {% endif %}

            {% if limit == "Memory" %}
                (GIB)
            {% endif %}
        </p>
    {% endfor %}

<p>
    These limits will apply until {{ expiration.strftime('%x') }} at {{expiration.strftime('%X')}} on the following hosts:
</p>

{% for host, port in violation.policy.affected_hosts %}
    {{ host }}
{% endfor %}


<p>
    Below is a summary of the usage that caused the violation.

    <p>
        <i style="font-size: 12pt;"> **This accounts for the difference between the overall usage and the collected PID usage (which can be less accurate)
            as well as an aggregate for processes that aren't in the top 7 processes in usage.
            This may be large if there are a lot of short-lived processes (such as compilers or quick commands) 
            that account for a significant fraction of the total usage.
